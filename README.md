# Welcome to the quicks-hits-cli repository

## Introduction

Documentation on the cli itself can be found [here](https://developer.genesys.cloud/devapps/cli/)

**Note:** The examples here refer to the fully generated CLI released at version v13.0.0. The see the examples for the old CLI, go to the [v12.0.0 tag](https://github.com/MyPureCloud/quick-hits-cli/releases/tag/v12.0.0).  

The quick hit cli repository holds various recipes and examples for using the Genesys Cloud CLI. Most of the examples are not full working scripts, but instead guides to how to undertake using the Genesys Cloud CLI. We welcome pull requests for new examples. We are not just looking for *nix-based Genesys Cloud CLI examples, but also Windows PowerShell examples. Many of the CLI examples in this repository are combined with other tools like [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and Unix commands (e.g. xargs).
